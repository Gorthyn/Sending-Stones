Sending Stones
Sending Stones is a React-based note-taking and game management app designed for avid tabletop gamers. It allows users to seamlessly manage their games, topics, and posts, as well as offering simple, yet effective dice rolling and combat tracking functionalities.

Features
Games, Topics, and Posts
At the core of Sending Stones, users can create, modify, read, and delete games - each game serving as a container for various topics. Topics can also be created, modified, read, and deleted within these games. Users can then further delve into detail by creating posts within topics. Each game, topic, and post can be fine-tuned to fit the user's specific needs, ensuring an organized and efficient gameplay experience.

Note Commenting
To add a more granular level of detail to your games, Sending Stones allows users to comment on posts with their notes. These notes can also be created, modified, read, and deleted, allowing users to easily manage their thought process and ensure no detail is lost or forgotten.

Dice Roller
Sending Stones comes with a built-in dice roller that allows users to roll any number and type of dice, ranging from the simple d4 to the mighty d100. This tool simplifies the gaming process, minimizing the need for physical dice and facilitating quick and effortless dice rolls.

Combat Tracker
Keeping track of combat in tabletop games can be a cumbersome process. Sending Stones addresses this with a straightforward and effective combat tracker. Users can easily add or remove player characters and enemies from the tracker, keeping everyone on top of the game's progress.
